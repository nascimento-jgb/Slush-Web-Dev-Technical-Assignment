# Slush-Web-Dev-Technical-Assignment
Created a small app using PERN stack (Postgres, Express, React and Node) within a timelimit of 12 hours of development.
The overall idea was to adapt a Todo app to be as closer as possible of Trello functionality.

## Key Learnings:

- Database setup and manipulation
- REST API
- React components and hooks
- Authentication
- Typescript basics
- UI/UX simple concepts

## Technologies

- PostgreSQL 15.3.1 (pgAdmin 4)
- Express 4.18.2
- React 18.2.6
- Node 20.1.0
- Typescript 5.0.4

(More details about the dependencies at package.json file.)

## How to use?
  
  Type `npm run build` inside of the main directory after cloning. (It will install all dependencies and node modules)
  <br></br>
  Then run still in the server directory `npm run start` and after that open a new tab in the terminal and run `npm run start` in the client one.
  <br></br>
  The page will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to check the result.
